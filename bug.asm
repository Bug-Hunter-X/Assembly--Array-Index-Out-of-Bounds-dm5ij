mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4] ; This instruction assumes that ecx is a valid index into an array stored at ebx.  If ecx is too large, it will cause an array out-of-bounds error, leading to unexpected behavior or a crash.

mov ecx, 100 ; Example where ecx could be out of bounds
mov ebx, array_start ; ebx points to the start of array
mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4] ; Accessing the array
